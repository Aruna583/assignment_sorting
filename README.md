# Packages Used

JSON Server was used to create a basic mock API for data handling during development.

Vite was used as the build tool for setting up the React project, ensuring fast development and hot module replacement.

Tailwind CSS was implemented for efficient and utility-first styling of the user interface.

dnd-kit was used to enable smooth drag-and-drop functionality within the application.

The UI was made responsive to support both mobile and desktop views.

React Icons package was used to include scalable and customizable icons throughout the UI.

Cloudinary was used for generating and hosting image URLs dynamically.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
